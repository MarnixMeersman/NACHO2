## Introduction
The NACHO project, developed by students at Delft University of Technology, focuses on characterizing Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) to enhance knowledge about their albedo, surface temperature, composition, rotational rate, and orbit. This information is critical for future asteroid studies, including mining, orbit modeling, and potentially redirecting hazardous NEOs.

## Mission Summary
NACHO aims to observe NEOs through infrared spectro-polarimetry, employing an innovative dual-channel optical assembly consisting of an immersive grating, a HeCdTe semiconductor detector, and a CCD polarimeter. The mission will operate in a Sun-synchronous orbit at 800 km altitude, with a nominal duration of 3 years&#8203;``【oaicite:4】``&#8203;.

### Key Features:
- Dual-channel optical system for detailed NEO characterization.
- Sun-synchronous orbit for optimal observation conditions.
- 3-axis stabilized spacecraft with a total mass of approximately 100 kg.
- Telemetry rate of 1.45 Gbit/day downlink, powered by solar panels.

## Mission Strategy
The NACHO mission employs machine learning algorithms to cluster asteroid ephemerides, forming groups of NEOs located in proximity for efficient observation. This strategy optimizes the telescope's pointing and maximizes scientific return&#8203;``【oaicite:3】``&#8203;.

## Scientific Objectives
NACHO will focus on known NEOs, particularly those greater than 100 m in diameter, which pose significant impact risks. The mission will utilize spectropolarimetry to determine NEOs' surface composition and albedo with high precision, enhancing our understanding of their potential trajectories and impact risks&#8203;``【oaicite:2】``&#8203;.

### Instrumentation
NACHO's spectropolarimeter instrument is crucial for achieving the mission's scientific goals. It's designed to characterize the light from asteroids using IR spectrometry and polarimetry, thereby providing comprehensive data on NEOs' surface properties&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;.
