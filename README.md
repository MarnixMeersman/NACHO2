![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarnixMeersman/NACHO2/main/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif)

## Introduction
NACHO (Near Earth Object Clustering Algorithm) is an innovative tool designed to enhance the efficiency of observatories in tracking clusters of Near Earth Objects (NEOs). By minimizing the time required for telescopes to switch focus between different NEOs, NACHO plays a crucial role in space observation and research.

## Technical Details
NACHO employs various clustering algorithms, including K-means, to group NEOs based on their trajectories and positions. This approach allows observatories to monitor multiple objects simultaneously, significantly improving NEO tracking capabilities.

### Features:
- Multiple clustering algorithms, including K-means.
- Real-time analysis and categorization of NEOs.
- User-friendly interface for observatories and researchers.
